# Machine-Learning-Final-Project
Given information about users of an online shopping site (E-Commerce), we built a model that predicts what is the chance of a particular user, to purchase while browsing the site. This project was part of Intro to Machine Learning course at Tel Aviv University.

Done as the final project for an intro to ML course. We were given a real data -set containing 22 features of hotel orders, some known and some anonymous, and were tasked with building a classifier to classify whether an order would be canceled or not. the project contains exploratory data analysis and visualization feature selection and engineering, and model building and validation. achieved 3 rd highest test AUC in the class using random forest
