# Machine-Learning-Final-Project
### By: Noam Dothan and Karin Agam

Done as the final project for an Intro to Machine Learning course at Tel Aviv University.

We were given a real data - set containing 22 features about users of an online shopping site (E-Commerce), some known and some anonymous, and were tasked with building a classifier to classify whether a particular user, would purchase while browsing the site or not.
The project contains exploratory data analysis, visualization, feature selection and engineering, modeling and validation.

The project achieved *the 3rd highest test AUC score (92.1%)* in the class using the Random Forest model.
