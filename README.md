Done as the final project for an Intro to Machine Learning course at Tel Aviv University.

We were given a real data - set containing 22 features about users of an online shopping site (E-Commerce), some known and some anonymous, and were tasked with building a classifier to classify whether a particular user, would purchase while browsing the site or not.
the project contains exploratory data analysis and visualization feature selection and engineering, and model building and validation.

Achieved *3rd highest test AUC (92.1%)* in the class using the Random Forest model.
